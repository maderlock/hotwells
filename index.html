    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <h2 id="the-issue">The Issue</h2>
    <p>Cathedral Schools Trust claims Hotwells Primary is no longer viable and must either close or be merged into Cathedral Primary School (CPS) - taking on its name, uniform, and Church of England designation. They plan to have early years and key stage 1 on the former Hotwells site and key stage 2 at the current CPS site.</p>
    <p>In reality, this is not a merger but a takeover that would end 100 years of Hotwells Primary as we know it. Two of the three objectives driving the consultation are not even related to Hotwells: getting more space for Cathedral Primary and helping Bristol reduce primary admission numbers across the city.</p>
    <p>The Trust has failed to provide convincing evidence to justify such a drastic decision. Hotwells has had some difficult years with lower pupil numbers, but the Trust&#39;s claim that Hotwells is financially unviable is unconvincing. The situation is improving, despite the Trust having made little effort to support or invest in making the school sustainable. Many in the local area are unaware of the school, highlighting the lack of marketing in recent years, suggesting opportunity for greater numbers.</p>
    <p>Hotwells is a high-performing, inclusive school that plays a vital role in the local community and provides the kind of nurturing environment that many children simply won&#39;t find elsewhere. Whether the current proposal is accepted or not, the Trust&#39;s intention remains: to shut down Hotwells. This move is not in the best interest of the children, families, or the wider community.</p>
    <h2 id="what-we-stand-to-lose">What We Stand to Lose</h2>
    <h3 id="a-high-achieving-supportive-community-driven-school">A High-Achieving, Supportive, Community-Driven School</h3>
    <p>Hotwells provides a uniquely nurturing environment rooted in its small size, non-uniform, and inter-year support. Academically it exceeds the national SATS exceeds-expectations by 10-20% placing the school among <a href="https://www.bristolworld.com/education/14-top-bristol-primary-schools-progress-scores-ofsted-5125855?page=3">Bristol&#39;s top performers</a>.</p>
    <p>Ofsted rated Hotwells &quot;Good&quot; in September 2022, praising its inclusive, nurturing ethos where &quot;pupils feel safe and well looked after&quot; and &quot;enjoy coming to school and take pride in their work&quot;. They also said that parental feedback was the most overwhelmingly positive they had ever seen, testament to the loyalty it inspires.</p>
    <p>For many children, especially those who struggle in larger, more formal settings, Hotwells offers the individual attention and emotional safety they need to thrive. This kind of care and level of achievement is much harder to replicate in a larger school.</p>
    <h3 id="loss-of-a-secular-choice">Loss of a Secular Choice</h3>
    <p>Hotwells is the only non-religious school in the ward and many families chose it for exactly that reason. The proposed merger would impose a Church of England ethos, undermining the school&#39;s inclusive identity and alienating families who value secular education.</p>
    <h3 id="deep-community-integration">Deep Community Integration</h3>
    <p>Hotwells is a vital part of local life. From the West Bristol Arts Trail to the Hotwells Panto and the intergenerational lunch club, the school plays a key role in bringing people together across age and background. Losing it would mean severing these long-standing community ties.</p>
    <h3 id="child-independence-and-local-connection">Child Independence and Local Connection</h3>
    <p>Children walk to Hotwells. They visit friends, grow in confidence, and develop independence in a safe and familiar environment. Parents know each other, support one another, and build strong informal networks.</p>
    <p>Whether the school is closed outright or merged into a split-site arrangement, many children will face longer journeys and risk being separated from their peers. Families who currently walk will be forced to drive, increasing traffic and congestion in the city centre at an already busy time, undermining Bristol&#39;s sustainable transport goals.  The close-knit, walkable community that Hotwells fosters will be lost.</p>
    <h3 id="supporting-local-growth">Supporting Local Growth</h3>
    <p>Many current pupils live in the local flats. Over 1,000 new homes are planned in the Harbourside area. Closing Hotwells now would leave this growing population underserved and force more families to travel further afield. Keeping Hotwells open is essential for future school place planning and a sustainable, walkable community. The merger does not guarantee the number of places reserved for the local community in the new school.</p>
    <h2 id="issues-with-the-consultation-process">Issues with the Consultation Process</h2>
    <p>The consultation process surrounding the proposed closure and merger of Hotwells Primary is deeply inadequate. With only five weeks of engagement, well short of best-practice standards and poorly- timed, the consultation has not allowed families or the wider community the time or clarity needed to respond meaningfully. Despite The Trust working on these plans for over two years, parents were given very limited notice, and key decisions appear to have been made in advance.</p>
    <p>The Cathedral Schools Trust has made no effort to let the local community know about this change that will have an impact on the area. This lack of transparency and genuine engagement raises serious concerns about the integrity of the decision-making process.</p>
    <p>The Trust have not published information about why alternatives were rejected and do not have financial modelling that a merged split-site school would be viable, nor the percentage of places that would be reserved for the local community. </p>
    <h2 id="we-disagree-with-the-premise-of-the-consultation-that-hotwells-primary-must-close">We disagree with the premise of the consultation that Hotwells Primary must close</h2>
    <p>We call on Cathedral Schools Trust, the Department for Education, and all decision-makers to protect this high-performing, community-first school. We demand the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The current consultation must be withdrawn</li>
    <li>No decision should be made until meaningful steps have been taken to support the school&#39;s sustainability in partnership with the community</li>
    <li>Any plan should retain secular educational provisions onsite that serve the local community and keep the Hotwells identity</li>
    <li>All current Hotwells pupils must have the option to continue their education together</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our children deserve more than a cost-cutting exercise - they deserve the proven, nurturing education that Hotwells provides.</p>

      <h3>Important Information Before Providing Feedback</h3>
      <p><strong>The consultation runs until 7th July.</strong> Your feedback is your own, but here are some of the points many Hotwells parents feel strongly about:</p>
      <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>Consultation process has been inadequate.</li>
        <li>The school should be kept open as numbers continue to improve, but the trust are acting as a business not trustees of a community resource.</li>
        <li>Hotwells is different to CPS in ethos, uniform, and catchment.</li>
        <li>We should maintain secular education options in the area.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your thoughtful response can make a difference in this important decision.</p>
